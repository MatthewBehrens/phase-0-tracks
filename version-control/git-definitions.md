# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

    version control is used to edit a program without ruining the "master" copy of it, and allows for more organization.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

    A branch is essentially one feature that is going to be added to the program. You would use one to work on many different features for the same program at once, then in the end merge them all into the master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
   
  A commit is a message you leave yourself that explains what was changed since the last commit. A good commit message is detailed and explains everything that has been changed.

* What is a merge conflict?

    a merge conflict is when two different edits to the program are merged together. This can happen when two people make the same file name and merge them together or if they edit the same line of code in a different way
